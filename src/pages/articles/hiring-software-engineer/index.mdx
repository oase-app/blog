**Oase is looking for a human who creates products by writing code.**  
Also known as: ___a software engineer___.

We’re building a new kind of social technology – one that supports real-world relationships rather than hijacking them. We want tech that strengthens communities instead of pulling them apart.

Oase is a group chat app for people who already know each other in real life – families, friend groups, school classes, local teams. It’s a tool for coordination and communication *without all the tricks*. No streaks. No endless scroll. No attention traps. Just better tools for real life.

We’re funded and live on the web and in the app stores. Now we’re building the core team.

## 🛠️ Your role
You’ll join early – like, really early.
This means you’ll have real influence on how we build, how we work, and what kind of culture we create together.

You’ll be part of the small (but growing) team, working close togehter with our founder, Anders Lemke-Holstein. Anders has a strong background in product and technology, so you will be able to lean on the foundation he’s built so far. That being said, you’ll also be expected to take ownership of your work and help shape the future of Oase.

The stack you will be working in:

- Event sourcing
- PostgreSQL
- Elixir/Phoenix
- React Native + Tailwind 

You are not required to know these technologies, but we need you to hit the ground running, so you should be comfortable with similar technologies. We’re looking for someone who can learn quickly, adapt to our stack and execute our roadmap.

## 👤 You
We’re building a product that’s ethical, humane, and useful.

So we expect that you:

- Care about ethics in tech and are aware of the potential impact of your work.
- Are not afraid to stand up for your values.
- Can execute your ideas.
- Are opinionated, but not rigid.
- Think humans-first.

Ideally you bring a new perspective to the team – whether that’s through your background, your experience, or your interests. We're aiming for a diverse team that can help us build the product and workplace that works for everyone.

## 🌱 The way we work
It's still too early to have a fully defined and formulated process. But we have clear values and goals for how we want to work together.

Our core values are based on thoughts from regenerative principles, deep work, slow productivity, and resonance.

- **Regenerative**: We want to build a product that is sustainable and ethical. We want to create a workplace that is healthy and supportive.
- **Deep**: We want to create a workplace that allows for deep work because that is where the value is created.
- **Slow**: We want to work at a natural pace. Doing less, but obsessing over quality.
- **Resonant**: We want to create a product that allows for people to resonate with each other, and we want to create a workplace that resonates with us.

## 🧭 Practical details

- We’re based in Copenhagen, but remote-friendly.
- Starting date: as soon as possible.
- Salary depending on profile – equity is an option.
- We’re funded for the next phase and backed by people who care about impact.
