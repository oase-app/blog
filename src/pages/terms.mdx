## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By using Oase, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you don’t agree to this Agreement, do not use Oase.

## 2. Description of Oase

Oase is a communications platform that allows groups of people to communicate and coordinate their work. Users can create multiple individual Oases, with each Oase acting as a separate, encapsulated space for sharing content such as messages, images, videos, events, files, and more. Each user needs to create a unique profile for each Oase they join. Users can invite others to join their Oases by sharing a unique access link.

## 3. User Registration

Users authenticate using Promise Authentication, a privacy-first service that does not share personally identifiable information with Oase.

## 4. Age verification and consent from legal guardians.

Before entering, joining, or creating an oase, users will have to provide their birth month. This will be used to calculate an approximate age of the user. If the user is under the age of 16, they will be asked to get consent to use Oase from their legal guardian. The legal guardian will have to login, provide their age, and then give their child consent. People who are 16 years or older can use Oase without consent from their legal guardian. Only people who are 18 years or older can act as legal guardians.

## 5. User Conduct

Users are expected to behave in a respectful and law-abiding manner. Specific behaviors that are not permitted include, but are not limited to:

a. Posting or sharing content that is abusive, threatening, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, offensive, or that promotes violence, discrimination, or unlawful behavior.
b. Harassing, stalking, or otherwise violating the legal rights of others.
c. Engaging in activity that interferes with or disrupts the functionality of Oase.
d. Sharing any material that infringes upon the intellectual property rights of others.
e. Falsely representing oneself or creating a false identity.
f. Misusing others’ personal information.

Violation of these rules may result in termination of service.

## 6. Intellectual Property

Oase claims no ownership of the content that users post in their Oases.

## 7. Data Protection and Privacy

For more information on how user data is collected, stored, and used, please refer to our Privacy Policy at https://oase.app/privacy

In that case, I'd suggest revising the "Changes to the Agreement" section to explain that any updates will be posted on the website or directly within the Oase app. Here's how that might look:

## 8. Changes to the Agreement

Oase reserves the right to revise this Agreement at any time. All changes will be posted on the Oase website and/or communicated within the Oase app. Your continued use of Oase after a change has been posted constitutes your acceptance of the modified Agreement.

## 9. Dispute Resolution

Any disputes arising out of this agreement shall be governed by Danish law and are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Denmark.

## 10. Disclaimer of Warranty

Oase is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind, express or implied.

## 11. Limitation of Liability

To the extent permitted by law, Oase will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or in connection with this agreement or the use of Oase.

## 12. Contact
