This Privacy Policy describes how Our Oase ApS ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, stores, and shares personal information when you use our Oase app (the "App").

## Information We Collect

We collect and store the following types of personal information solely for providing functionality within the App:
- Name: We collect your name to identify you to others in your oases.
- Content: Any content you provide within the App is only used to display to other members of your oases.

## Purpose of Data Collection
The personal information we collect is strictly used for providing functionality within the App. We do not use the collected data for any other purposes.

## Data Storage and Processing
We store the collected data in a database hosted by Amazon. We ensure that no data is stored outside the European Union (EU).

## Cookies and Tracking Technologies
We do not use cookies or any other tracking mechanisms within the App.

## GDPR Compliance and User Rights
We comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If you have any requests regarding your personal information, please contact us at info@oase.app. We will promptly address your inquiries and requests.

## Data Security
We take appropriate measures to safeguard the personal information stored in our databases. Only trusted employees have access to the data, and we follow industry-standard security practices to prevent unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.

## Data Retention
We store the data as long as oases exist. However, under certain circumstances, data deletion may occur if it aligns with a business plan where keeping data longer than a specific period incurs costs.

## Third-Party Links
The App does not contain any third-party links. This Privacy Policy applies solely to our App and does not cover any external websites or services.

## Policy Updates
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as necessary. Users will be notified if there are any changes that affect the strict nature of the policy.
